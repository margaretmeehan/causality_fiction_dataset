## File Descriptions

- **CausalityAnnotationHandbook**: This is the guidebook we gave students before they annotated causal pairs in the selected passages. 
- **POSITIVE_literary_data.csv**: These are the unfiltered pairs marked as causally related. 
- **BERT_literary_data.csv**: This is the data used to train our BERT model. It contains only intra-sentence causal pairs, since this model worked at the sentence level only. 
- **PAIRS_literary_data.csv**: This is the data used to train our causal pairs model.
